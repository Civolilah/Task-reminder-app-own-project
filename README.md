# Task Reminder

Task Reminder is my own project based on apps like any.do. The main purpose of the app is to add a task to schedule time and be notified audibly when you should start or finish the task.

The application has been deployed on Azure for approximately 2 months and has received worldwide visitors. The domain was tasksreminders.com.

Here's a link to a promotional video where I explained how everything works in the app: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_KpddrSUr8

Maybe some of the packages will expire or the version of C# will not be supported anymore when you check the project, because I don't work on the application anymore, but the structure of the project, the technical skills are obvious from the code.

Thanks,
Abedin
